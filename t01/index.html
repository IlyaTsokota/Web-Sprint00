					The stone allows its owner to exist in any surrounding space, be it space or underwater depths; move
					objects, yourself and other creatures to any corner of the universe; deform and rebuild space.

					The stone allows you to increase the strength of the wearer's consciousness and gain access to the
					thoughts and dreams of other beings. Supported by the Power Stone, with its help it is possible to
					simultaneously access all existing minds. The stone can also release inner demons and drive them
					back.

				<td>
					Perhaps the most dangerous of all, this stone is intelligent and hungry that only souls can satisfy.
					It allows its owner to abduct, subdue, and alter the souls of the living or the dead. Adam Warlock
					was the only guardian of this stone for many years and felt responsible for all those souls that he
					himself took. Ironically, the stone is the gateway to an idyllic pocket universe.

					The stone allows its owner complete control over time. With its help, the past, present and future
					become available or visible. Perfectly wielding the stone, the wearer can use its power as a weapon,
					trapping enemies or even entire worlds in endless loops of time. The stone can also cause objects
					and creatures to physically return to adolescence or age.

				<td>Reality</td>
				<td>Red</td>
				<td>
					The stone has access to all the power and energy that has ever existed or will exist in the future,
					nourishes other stones and enhances their effects. The stone allows the wearer to duplicate almost
					any physical superhuman ability and become invulnerable, and therefore invincible, using only one
					solid strength.

				<td>Power</td>
				<td>Purple</td>
				<td>
					Perhaps the most powerful of all stones and the most difficult to use. The stone allows its owner to
					fulfill any desires, even if these desires are contrary to scientific laws. If used carelessly, the
					stone can lead to disaster. By touching the border of reality, it causes catastrophic damage that
					can only be isolated by the power of the Stone of Cosmos, the Stone of Souls and the Stone of Power.
