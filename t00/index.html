	<h2 id="anchor"> What makes a superhero?</h2>
	<p>
		superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
		couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <strong>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a
			normal human being could possess,</strong> and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
		Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy
		could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a
		superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a
		normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

		the same fictional universe known as Arrowverse. The series follows Barry Allen, portrayed by Grant Gustin, a
